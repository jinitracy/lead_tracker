# lead_tracker

Lead Tracker is a chrome extension which uses basic JavaScript concepts such as lists and arrays to build a lead tracking app which tracks all the urls entered and it also makes use of the local storage concepts to save the urls for next session. The output won't erase until and unless the user presses the clear all button.
